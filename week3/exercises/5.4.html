      const myTable = []; // we create the array which will hold the rows
      const numRows = 4; // we declare that we want 4 rows
      const numCol = 7; // and 7 columns, or, that we want 7 numbers in each row.
      let counter = 0; //declaring the counter outside of our loop will allow it to retain its current value through each iteration of our row creation.
