        - Add the canvas element to the page.
        - Set the width and height to 640 px and, using CSS, add a 1 pc border to the element.
        - Within the JavaScript, select the canvas element and set the Context to 2d.
        - Set the fill style to red.
        - Create an output of the shape by using a rectangle.
        - Set the outline of the rectangle.
        - Clear the rectangle inside to make it transparent and the color of the background.

      ctx.clearRect(30, 30, 520, 520); //clearRect() is also introduced after this exercise. -_-
