      // I start by creating a new variable that stores my Promise. It immediately resolves and returns the string. Then it logs the value from the resolve and returns a new string. Looking at the books appendix, this was solved differently.
      let myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        resolve("Start Counting");
      })
        .then((value) => {
          console.log(value); //this logs Start Counting
          return "One";
        })
        .then((value) => {
          console.log(value);
          return "Two";
        })
        .then((value) => {
          console.log(value);
          return "Three";
        })
        .then((value) => {
          console.log(value);
        })
        .catch((value) => {
          console.log(value);
        });
      //end myPromise

      //The book accomplishes the same thing using a counter function. One big difference I notice here is how you start the then process. Since I closed out the pinkyPromise variable with a semi colon, I have to select the variable and append .then to call the then function. It turns out you can select the variable and then skip down a line and start then on a new line. Writing it out on one line still works but makes it very awkward to read.
      let pinkyPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        resolve("Start Counting: pinky Promise");
      });

      function counter(val) {
        console.log(val);
      }

      pinkyPromise
        .then((value) => {
          counter(value); //this call to counter logs Start Counting: Pinky Promise
          return "One: pinky";
        })
        .then((value) => {
          counter(value);
          return "Two: pinky";
        })
        .then((value) => {
          counter(value);
          return "Three: pinky";
        })
        .then((value) => {
          counter(value);
        });
      //end pinkyPromise
