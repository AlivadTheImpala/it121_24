# About

This repository holds the homework assignments for the Javascript 1 course IT 121.

Additionally, the exercises for the book _Javascript from Beginner to Professional_ are sprinkled in according to our weekly reading plan.

## My Approach

While reading through the book I like to have my notebook and write in my own words, my understanding of the terms and concepts. When working on the exercises I also like to leave comments that explain the process. This is not meant to be a tutorial for anybody and should not be interepreted as such. 

It is a way for me to solidify what Im learning at the level that I understood it when I wrote the code. I like to add the comments at the end once I look over the code I have written.
